# Mastering-PyCharm
Exercises from Talk Python Training - Mastering PyCharm by Michael C Kennedy

All exercises here were originally created by Michael C Kennedy and provided for the course, but these ones are changed; they have my changes, doodlings, marks and scars from practising. They are all working code but have a bent towards my particular personality and knowledge.

I installed the Presentation Assistant. Found in PyCharm under Configuration->Settings->Plugins then search for the plugin and install it.
